This is a very simple block explorer using the alchemy endpoints, 
Functionalites include , Show current block number /display block details/ show current gas.

reqfunctions.js file contains all the functions that calls the alchemy api for the above data..

Currently the search function only includes fetching block data information through the alchemy api, I will include other functionalites and much better UI soon.
